This Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) is made this ____ day of ____ 2017

Between

The _Digital Transformation Agency_, as represented by their Domain Name Section

and

the Australian Bureau of Statistics, the Australian National University, the Bureau of
Meteorology, the Commonwealth Scientific Industrial Research Organisation, the
Department of Finance, the Department of Human Services, Geoscience Australia and the
National Archives of Australia (the other participants to this MoU), as represented by their
participants in the Australian Government Linked Data Working Group.

## 1. Purpose
The purpose of this MoU is to ensure that any changes to the Domain Name System (DNS)
records for the `linked.data.gov.au` domain name involves a consultative process
between the Digital Transformation Agency, who technically and authoritatively manages the
DNS records, and the other participants in this MoU via the Australian Government Linked
Data Working Group (AGLDWG).

This will be achieved by:

First, any potential DNS changes initiated by the Digital Transformation Agency or requested
by a 3rd party, including other participants in this MoU, be communicated to the participants
of this MoU via AGLDWG communication channels (email list) who will then have an
opportunity to reflect on possible implications of the change for their purposes.

Second, the participants to this MoU will then have the opportunity to raise concerns with the
Digital Transformation Agency, if any and seek an amicable resolution.

## 2. Background
The reason for this is MoU is that changes to the domain and subdomain DNS records for
data.gov.au can have large impacts on the operating of Internet-based systems that rely the on
long-term stability of those DNS records.

Currently AGLDWG members rely on several data.gov.au subdomains to redirect web
requests from long-term persistent web locations (PIDs) to web resource delivery systems.
Current reliance, as of February 2018 is on:

    linked.data.gov.au
    environment.data.gov.au
    governance.data.gov.au
    lab.environment.data.gov.au
    linked.data.gov.au
    transport.data.gov.au
    reference.data.gov.au

Future reliance is to be placed on the subdomain `linked.data.gov.au` and subsubdomains
of it only:

    linked.data.gov.au – the current AGLDWG website
    *. linked.data.gov.au – multiple AGIFT-based sub-subdomains of linked.data.gov.au

This is to ensure that other subdomains of data.gov.au that the data.gov.au team relies on
DNS records for, for example data.gov.au & search.data.gov.au are isolated.

Current, informal, arrangements for the AGLDWG’s use of subdomains is arranged by the
Digital Transformation Agency’s Domain Name Management section who delegate
*.data.gov.au to web servers within the AGLDWG’s control except for specific records for
data.gov.au, search.data.gov.au & blog.data.gov.au. This allows the AGLDWG to manage all
subdomains of data.gov.au not explicitly managed with individual DNS records, as
data.gov.au and search.data.gov.au are. This will change with the delegation of
linked.data.gov.au to AGLDWG’s control only.

## 3. Legal status of this MoU
The participants in this MoU do not intend to, nor do they have the authority to, create any
legally binding relationship or obligations by entering in to this MoU.

## 4. Duration of this MoU
This MoU has effect for a period of five years from the date of its execution unless earlier
terminated or extended by participants in accordance with Section 11.

## 5. Participant Representatives
The Digital Transformation Agency shall be represented by their senior executive responsible
for their Domain Name Management section or a nominee of that person.
Other participants to this MoU shall be represented by their members of the AGLDWG.

## 6. Cooperation
The participants will actively maintain a cooperative relationship in order to pre-empt issues
for any other participant resulting from DNS planned or actual changes.

## 7. Recognition
The Digital Transformation Agency recognises the AGLDWG as an unofficial, yet important,
government community of practice that promotes and represents a series of federal
Government entities who seek to implement and use Linked Data technologies for the
betterment of Australian Government data sharing via the Internet.

The Digital Transformation Agency also recognises the delegates of the other participants to
the AGLDWG as representing the Linked Data interests of those other participants.

The other participants recognise the Digital Transformation Agency as the current and correct
_de facto_ and _de jure_ manager of the data.gov.au domain name and its DNS records.
The other participants also recognise the delegates of all participants to the AGLDWG as
representing those participants Linked Data interests.

The other participants also recognise the Department of Finance’s previous, long-term and
sustained interest in Linked Data technologies and the AGLDWG and previous DNS support.

## 8. Digital Transformation Agency Undertaking
The Digital Transformation Agency will:

Communicate any potential DNS changes initiated by the Digital Transformation Agency or
requested by a 3rd party, including other participants in this MoU, be to the other participants
of this MoU via AGLDWG communication channels (email list) who will then have an
opportunity to reflect on possible implications of the change for their purposes.

Hear reasonable requests from other participants in this MoU, via AGLDWG communication
channels for alterations to potential DNS changes if the potential changes are thought to
cause problems for the other participants’ systems.

## 9. Other participants undertakings
The other participants to this MoU will:

Communicate concerns about any potential or actual DNS changes to both the Digital
Transformation Agency and one another via AGLDWG communication channels.

## 10. Joint undertakings
Both the Digital Transformation Agency and the other participants will:

Work in good faith with the other participants to resolve any potentially problematic changes
to data.gov.au DNS records.

## 11. Variation & Termination
This MoU may be varied or terminated by either the Digital Transformation Agency or their
other participants at any time and any such variation or termination shall be set out in writing
and signed by both the Digital Transformation Agency and either all of the other participants
or the AGLDWG on their behalf. Notification of variation or termination shall also be given
to AGLDWG members via AGLDWG communication channels.

## 12. Dispute resolution
All participants to this MoU agree to use reasonable efforts to resolve by negotiation any
problems that arise among them (disputes).

If disputes are not able to be resolved by negotiation of participants’ representatives, the
dispute shall be raised to SES-level APS officers representing the participants. This is to
ensure that difficult issues are dealt with at an appropriate level of seniority.

## 13. Record keeping
The participants will document the administration of this MoU in writing, likely email
communication.
