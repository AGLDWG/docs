## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this document is to record the terms under which the Australian Government Linked Data Working Group (AGLDWG) operates.

## 2. Introduction

### 2.1	Linked Data

The term "Linked Data" refers to a set of practices for publishing and linking structured data on the Web. Data that is Linked Data is linked to other data and can in turn be linked to from other data. It is also data that is published in a machine-readable way, meaning all terms used are explicitly defined both in formats and meaning. 

The term "Linked Data" is differentiated from other forms of data linkage by the use of title case (capital "L" and capital "D"). 

### 2.2 The Working Group

This AGLDWG aims to achieve its [Objectives](#3-objectives) by operating under its [Terms of Reference](#4-terms-of-reference). 

The AGLDWG is informally constituted in Australian Government - it is a voluntary working group with no formal departmental sponsor - nevertheless it has been, and continues to be, influential within Government, as measured by references to the AGLDWG's activities and the inplementations of its recommendations.

### 2.3 History of the AGLDWG

The Australian Government Linked Data Working Group was established in August 2012 to meet the Linked Data challenges facing the Australian government. At the time, Linked Data was a technology seeing new adoption in governments such as that of the UK, the USA and various Eurpoean countries.

The AGLDWG originally consisted of mainly scientific agencies (bureau of Meteorology, CSIRO, Geoscience Australia etc.) and some data agencies (the then Department of Communications) and, at one time, the AGLDWG was formally constituted under the Department of Communications. 

From 2013, member organisations of the AGLDWG started using subomains of the Internet domain `data.gov.au` for Linked Data data and systems.

In 2015, the AGLDWG implemented an _IRI Redirection Service_, which is a system that allows for wide use of the `linked.data.gov.au` Internet subdomain for technical Linked Data purposes. This system, which is now a core Australian Government Linked Data infrastruture, continues to operate.

With changing Departmental responsibilities, the AGLDWG ceased to be formally constituted and also became more involved with the Digital Transformation Agency (DTA) which, in about 2017, assumed management of many government Internet domains, in particular `data.gov.au`. 

The AGLDWG established a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in 2018 that called upon the DTA to manage the `linked.data.gov.au` subdomain in accordance with the persistent Internet domain requirements of good Linked Data on behalf of the other MoU signatories. The other signatories were then all members of the AGLDWG and consisted of:

* Bureau of Meteorology
* Commonwealth Scientific Industrial Research Organisation
* Department of Finance
* Geoscience Australia
* National Archives of Australia

In 2021, the following organisations also signed the MoU:

* Australian Bureau of Statistics
* Australian Research Data Commons

In 2019, the AGLDWG established its first Terms of Reference (ToR) document. That document has now been superceded by this document.

In mid 2021, AGLDWG's existing ToR & MoU documents were found to be insufficiently drafted for non-Australian Public Service agency use, thus a process what initiated to re-issue them. One result of this process is this document. The other is the updated MoU.


## 3. Objectives

### 5.2 Members

Organisations may join the AGLDWG as a _Working Group Member Organisation_ if they can provide representatitves that faithfully represent their interests to attend AGLDWG meetings.

Representatives of organisations who are _Working Group Member Organisations_ constitute the ordinary members of the AGLDWG and attend meetings, participate in AGLDWG discussions (mailing lists etc.) and carry our AGLDWG business. For the purposes of quorum and voting, a AGLDWG Member Organisation must have at least one _Representative_ present in a meeting.

An organisations that signs the MoU is considered to be a _Working Group Signatory Organisation_ with the ability to vote on AGLDWG matters with one vote per organisation. Voting shall be used to determine _Office Bearers_ and may also be used to decide other AGLDWG issues. Counts of _Working Group Signatory Organisations_, as represented by at least one _Representative_, will be used to determine meeting quora.

Individuals - persons unafilliated with any organisation - may attend AGLDWG meetings and participate in AGLDWG activities.
