## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this document is to record the terms under which the Australian Government Linked Data Working Group (AGLDWG) operates.

## 2. Introduction

### 2.1	Linked Data

The term "Linked Data" refers to a set of practices for publishing and linking structured data on the Web. Data that is Linked Data is linked to other data and can in turn be linked to from other data. It is also data that is published in a machine-readable way, meaning all terms used are explicitly defined both in formats and meaning. 

The term "Linked Data" is differentiated from other forms of data linkage by the use of title case (capital "L" and capital "D"). 

Certainty regarding Internet domains for Linked Data operational purposes requires that the domain will not cease to resolve and that Domain Name System (DNS) entries and domain redirects established for it are not altered without dependent systems being able to cope with the alterations.

### 2.2 The Working Group

This AGLDWG aims to achieve its [Objectives](#3-objectives) by operating under its [Terms of Reference](#4-terms-of-reference). 

The AGLDWG is informally constituted in Australian Government - it is a voluntary working group with no formal departmental sponsor - nevertheless it has been, and continues to be, influential within Government, as measured by references to the AGLDWG's activities and the implementations of its recommendations.

### 2.3 History of the AGLDWG

The Australian Government Linked Data Working Group was established in August 2012 to meet the Linked Data challenges facing the Australian government. At the time, Linked Data was a technology seeing new adoption in governments such as that of the UK, the USA and various European countries.

The AGLDWG originally consisted of mainly scientific agencies (Bureau of Meteorology, CSIRO, Geoscience Australia etc.) and some data agencies (the then Department of Communications) and, at one time, the AGLDWG was formally constituted under the Department of Communications. 

From 2013, member organisations of the AGLDWG started using subdomains of the Internet domain `data.gov.au` for Linked Data data and systems.

In 2015, the AGLDWG implemented an _IRI Redirection Service_, which is a system that allows for wide use of the `linked.data.gov.au` Internet subdomain for technical Linked Data purposes. This system, which is now a core Australian Government Linked Data infrastructure, continues to operate.

With changing Departmental responsibilities, the AGLDWG ceased to be formally constituted and also became more involved with the Digital Transformation Agency (DTA) which, in about 2017, assumed management of many government Internet domains, in particular `data.gov.au`. 

The AGLDWG established a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in 2018 that called upon the DTA to manage the `linked.data.gov.au` subdomain in accordance with the persistent Internet domain requirements of good Linked Data on behalf of the other MoU signatories. The other signatories were then all members of the AGLDWG and consisted of:

* Bureau of Meteorology
* Commonwealth Scientific Industrial Research Organisation
* Department of Finance
* Geoscience Australia
* National Archives of Australia

In 2021, the following organisations also signed the MoU:

* Australian Bureau of Statistics
* Australian Research Data Commons

In 2019, the AGLDWG established its first Terms of Reference (ToR) document. That document has now been superseded by this document.

The 2018 MOU has also been updated and re-signed to more accurately reflect the roles and responsibilities of all members.

## 3. Terms of Reference

The AGLDWG aims to achieve the following objectives:

### 3.1

Increase the use of established Linked Data principles for Australia and within Australian government. 

### 3.2	

Establish technical guidance for Australian Government agencies regarding publishing Australian Government public sector information using Linked Data as a delivery technology.

### 3.3	

Encourage and support the use of the Internet domain `linked.data.gov.au` for Linked Data purposes by Australian government agencies and other Australian organisations.

### 3.4

Develop suggestions for governance rules and processes for the effective management of Australian Government Linked Data.

### 3.5

Provide a forum for the discussion of Linked Data issues for Australia and Australian government.

### 3.6	

Promote and explain Linked Data to data interest groups and communities of practice.

### 3.7	

Aid in the development of fundamental Linked Data infrastructure and Linked Data implementations within Australia and provide advice to Government Departments to do so.

### 3.8

Liaise with equivalent groups internationally to realise global benefits from Linked Data.

### 3.9

## 4. Working Group Structure

The AGLDWG will consist of:

### 4.1 Office Bearers

The AGLDWG only has one class of _Office Bearer_: Co-Chair.

The AGLDWG will elect between 2 and 4 Co-Chairs anually, at the AGLDWG's Annual General Meeting.

Co-chairs are only to be selected from _Representatives_ of _Working Group Signatory Organisations_.

Co-chairs are determined by a AGLDWG vote whereby candidates nominate in the month leading up to the Annual General Meeting, or during it. Candidates are then elected individually by majority votes to the Co-Chair positions.

### 4.2 Members

Organisations will be considered an AGLDWG as a _Working Group Member Organisation_ if they sign the [MoU regarding the linked.data.gov.au persistent domain name](https://github.com/AGLDWG/docs/blob/master/MoU.md).

Organisations whose do not sign the MoU, may be considered Observers. Individuals - persons unaffiliated with any organisation - may also attend AGLDWG meetings as Observers.

Representatives of Member and Observer organisations, and individuals, may attend AGLDWG meetings, participate in AGLDWG discussions (mailing lists etc.) and carry out AGLDWG business. 

Only a _Working Group Member Organisation_ may have its vote counted, not Observers. Member organisations must have at least one _Representative_ present in a meeting to vote on their behalf. _Working Group Member Organisation_ are allocated only one vote each.

### 4.3 Governance

The AGLDWG shall operate under a number of Co-Chairs who are responsible for: 

* providing strategic direction across the AGLDWG in line with government priorities and policy; 
* addressing cross-agency issues and conflicts referred to it by AGLDWG Members and recommending corrective action through appropriate negotiation and/or escalation;
* addressing items of risk and other issues, as referred by the AGLDWG Members, and recommending actions; 
* monitoring and reviewing the AGLDWG work plan implementation against the ToR on a regular basis; 
* administrative AGLDWG duties coordinating meetings and maintaining AGLDWG infrastructure and documents;
* recommending new organisations and participants be admitted to the AGLDWG.

The Co-Chairs will engaged with the wider AGLDWG via the mailing list and Monthly Meetings and propose major actions and outputs to them for review. Wider AGLDWG concerns regarding actiosna dn outputs that cannot be resolved through informal means must be voted on at Monthly Meeting.

## 4.4 Sub-working groups

The AGLDWG shall form subcommittees as needed to address tasks. All subcommittees formed will be announced to all AGLDWG members via the AGLDWG’s email list.

_NOTE_: under the AGLDWG's previous ToR, formal "Sub Groups" were constituted but this structuring was found to be inflexible.
