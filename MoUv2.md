## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this MoU is to ensure that the Internet domain `linked.data.gov.au` may be used for Linked Data purposes by Australian govenrment agencies and other Australian organisations with certainty. 

Certainty regarding Internet domains for Linked Data operational purposes requires that the domain will not cease to resolve and that Domain Name System (DNS) entries and domain redirects established for it are not altered without dependent systems being able to cope with the alterations.


## 2. Parties

### 2.1

The parties to this Memorandum of Understanding are:

1. the organisation responsible for the technical maintenance of the `data.gov.au` Internet domain name and, within that, the `linked.data.gov.au` subdomain;
2. Australian government organisations using the `linked.data.gov.au` for Linked Data purposes.

The first is hereafter refered to as _domain maintenance organisation_ and the latters as _signatory organisations_.

### 2.2

_**NOTE**: This section attempts to interpret valid signatory organisations by the impact of their accession on the other MoU Parties, not by particular properties of those organisations in isolation._

_The intention is to allow MoU Parties to determine who may sign the MoU, rather than conditions specified in the MoU, other than this conditions (Party determination)._

Organisations that may become _signatory organisations_ are organisations that may be accessioned without altering the MoU conditions for the _domain maintenance organisation_ and existing _signatory organisations_.


## 3. Establishment of MoU

This Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) is made on ____________________

Between

the _domain maintenance organisation_, as represented by their nominated _representative_

and

the _signatory organisations_, as represented by their nominated _representatives_.

The specific parties to this MoU are listed in [Schedule of Parties](#12-schedule-of-parties).


## 4. Background

### 4.1	Linked Data

The term "Linked Data" refers to a set of practices for publishing and linking structured data on the Web. Data that is Linked Data is linked to other data and can in turn be linked to from other data. It is also data that is published in a machine-readable way, meaning all terms used are explicitly defined both in formats and meaning. 

The term "Linked Data" is differentiated from other forms of data linkage by the use of title case (capital "L" and capital "D").

### 4.2 The Australian Government Linked Data Working Group

This Australian Government Linked Data Working Group (AGLDWG) that was established in 2012 to meet the Linked Data challenges facing the Australian government. It continues to operate still and is the coordinating party of this MoU.

The AGLDWG is an informally constituted organisation within Australian Government: it is a voluntary working group with no formal departmental sponsor. Nevertheless it has been, and continues to be, influential within Government, as measured by references to the AGLDWG's activities and the inplementations of its recommendations.

The AGLDWG has no powers to make inter-departmental or other arrangements and thus relies on its member organisations, as formal APS and non-APS organisations, to make arrangements between themselves regarding Linked Data matters.

### 4.3	Linked Data and Internet domains

Linked Data relies on Internet domains for data identification and discovery, thus for Linked Data to operate well over long periods of time, the Internet domains used must operate persist and operate consistently.

In 2010, the Australian government establised the `data.gov.au` Internet domain to be used for cross-departmental data purposes. The main purpose then, as now, was as the "central source of Australian open government data" - a data catalogue.

In 2012, member organisations of the AGLDWG started to use a various subdomains of the `data.gov.au` for Linked Data purposes, in particular:

* `lab.environment.data.gov.au` - for a Linked Data version of a climate dataset
* `environment.data.gov.au` - for multiple environmental datasets and models

In 2015, the AGLDWG implemented an _IRI Redirection Service_, which is a system that allows for wide use of the `linked.data.gov.au` Internet subdomain for technical Linked Data purposes. This system, which is now a core Australian Government Linked Data infrastruture, continues to operate.

As of 2021, there are hundreds of datasets, models, vocabularies and other resources dependent on the continued operation of `linked.data.gov.au` and several resources still dependent on `environment.data.gov.au` published by multiple Federal and State agencies.

## 5. Obligations

To ensure that the Internet domain `linked.data.gov.au` may be used for Linked Data purposes by Australian govenrment agencies and other Australian organisations with certainty, the following obligations are agreed to by the Parties to this MoU:

### 5.1

Any potential DNS changes initiated by the _domain maintenance organisation_ or requested by a 3rd party, including _signatory organisations_, will be communicated by the _domain maintenance organisation_ to the _signatory organisations_ to provide them with an opportunity to reflect on possible implications of the change.

### 5.2

_Signatory organisations_ will have the opportunity to raise any concerns with proposed changes to `linked.data.gov.au` with the _domain maintenance organisation_, and attempt to seek an amicable resolution.

### 5.3

Parties to this MoU will actively maintain a cooperative relationship in order to pre-empt issues for any other Party resulting from planned or actual changes to `linked.data.gov.au`.

Notification of variation or termination shall also be given to AGLDWG members via AGLDWG communication channels.


## 11. Dispute resolution

All Parties to this MoU agree to use reasonable efforts to resolve, by negotiation, any problems that arise among them.

If problems are not able to be resolved by negotiation of Partiesâ€™ representatives, the dispute shall be raised to SES-level APS officers representing the Parties. This is to ensure that difficult issues are dealt with at an appropriate level of seniority.


## 12. Schedule of Parties

The _domain maintenance organisation_ party to this MoU is the Australian Bureau of Statistics, since that agency has technical control of the `data.gov.au` domain name and thus all DNS records relating to the AGLDWG's domains.
