# Australian Government Linked Data Working Group
## Working group plan
### 2019-08-15

## 1	Introduction

1.1	The term “Linked Data” refers to a set of practices for publishing and linking structured data on the Internet. Data that is Linked Data is linked to other data and can in turn be linked to from other data. It is also data that is published in a machine-readable way meaning all terms used are explicitly defined both in formats and meaning. As Linked Data technologies advance and become more common place, it will be necessary for Government to become responsive to the needs of both its public, as well as its own entities. 

1.2	Predefining standards for guidance and establishing technical mechanisms for Linked Data implementations will ensure individuals, businesses and organisations can benefit from the opportunities these technologies offer.

1.3	Established in August 2012, the Australian Government Linked Data Working Group exists with support from the agencies that have signed the MOU. Furthermore, CSIRO and the Department of Finance, Online Services Branch who are responsible for the open data policy also provide support. The Working Group’s 2018 MOU saw the relationship between the Digital Transformation Agency and the Working Group become formalized, providing surety that any domain name change would be completed in negotiation with the Working Group in recognition of the Working Group’s role in maintaining Persistent IDs on behalf of the Australian Government. Its participating members have been drafting policy and technical guidance on the implementation of Linked Data for the Australian Government.
